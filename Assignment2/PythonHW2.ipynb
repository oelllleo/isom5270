    "# Introduction \n",
    "You just accepted a job at CausalMarketing, a firm that offers marketing consulting services. \n",
    "For your first assignment, you've been tasked with helping a large online clothing store, Nosara, with their targeted advertising campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nosara is promoting a new handbag model priced at ***$100***, which is not yet available for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "They randomly selected 3 million past customers and sent them emails offering the opportunity to pre-order the handbag. \n",
    "\n",
    "These customers were divided into two groups: \n",
    "***one received only the pre-order invitation (control group)***, and \n",
    "***the other received a 20% discount if they pre-ordered (treatment group)***. \n",
    "Each email allows the purchase of ***a single handbag***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nosara has ***10,979,592*** past customers who haven't been emailed yet. \n",
    "They want you to help them design a data-driven solution to \n",
    "decide which of these customers should ***receive a discount email*** and which should ***receive a regular email*** to ***maximize*** sales after discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nosara has shared two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "one of customers who have already been emailed (nosara_labeled) and another of customers not yet emailed (nosara_unlabeled). The fields are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Features (all numeric): f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11\n",
    "\n",
    "treatment: Indicates group (1 = treated, 0 = control). \n",
    "\n",
    "preorder: Indicates if the customer pre-ordered (1=Yes, 0=No).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Feature names were anonymized, and their values randomly projected to keep their predictive power without risking the privacy of Nosaraâ€™s customer base."
