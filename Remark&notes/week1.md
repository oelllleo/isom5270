## Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking 

### Data Science, Engineering, and Data-Driven Decision Making 

Data Science involve principles, processes and techniques for understanding phenonone via the analysis data.

The ultimate goal of data science as improving decision making, as this generally is of direct interest to business

***Data-driven decision-making(DDD)*** refers to the practice of basing decisions on the analysis of data, rather than purely on intuition

Typically, we have 2 types of decisions is making on DDD

1.  Decisions for which "discoveries" need to be made within data
e.g. What Walmart need to prepare for Hurricane Frances's imminent arrival

2. Decisions that repeat, especially at massive scale, and so decision-making can benefit from even small increases in decision-making accuracy based on data analysis.
e.g. MegaTelCo's know to lower the Chum rate by giving benefits (a free months)

### Data Processing and "Big Data"

Data processing $\neq$ data science

|Data Science | Data Processing| Big Data |
|---|---|---|
| Data science needs access todata and it often benefits from sophisticated data engineering that data processingtechnologies may facilitate, but these technologies are not data science technologies per se.   |  Data processing technologies are very important for many data-oriented business tasksthat do not involve extracting knowledge or data-driven decision-making, such as efficient transaction processing, modern web system processing, and online advertisingcampaign management. |Big data essentially means datasets that are too largefor traditional data processing systems, and therefore require new processing technologies. |

### From Big Data 1.0 to Big data 2.0

|Big Data 1.0| Big Data 2.0|
|---|---|
|Firms are busyingthemselves with building the capabilities to process large data, largely in support of theircurrent operations—for example, to improve efficiency.|Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: “What can I now do that I couldn’t do before, or do better than I could do before?” |

### Data and Data Science Capability as a Strategic Asset 

one of the fundamental principles of data science: 
- data, and the capability to extract useful knowledge from data, should be regarded as key strategic assets.It need talent and correct data to be come a great assets.

### Data-Analytic Thinking

When faced with a business problem, you should be able to assess whether and
how data can improve performance. 

There is a frameworks to structure the analysis so that it can be done systematically 

### Data Mining and Data Science, Revisited

4 fundamental concepts on Data ming and data science` 

Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems can be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages.

From a large mass of data, information technology can be used to
find informative descriptive attributes of entities of interest.

If you look too hard at a set of data, you will find something—but it might not generalize beyond the data you’re looking at.(Overfiting)

Formulating data mining solutions and evaluating the resultsinvolves thinking carefully about the context in which they will be used.
